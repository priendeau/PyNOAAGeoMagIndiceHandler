Description: A python interface to Space NOAA 
        ====================================
            A python interface to Space NOAA Magnetometer, Solar Wind Electron Proton, Differential Flux and 
            Anisotropy Index from ACE and Stereo A, B satellite. 
            
            In this package, I inclued pyaeso and bctc and Lomnicky stit Neutron detector as well 
            Space NOAA Magnetometer, Solar Wind Electron Proton, Differential Flux and Anisotropy Index, 
            to cross data. 
            
            This Module is a project aim to get folding indice of magnetic permeability while solar 
            flare higher than Class M. This Solara flare are mitigating the electricity current 
            flow during solar flare event and magnetic storm, and can be predicted by corrected 
            humain normal energy consumption prediction and the normal proton pression existing 
            around many region where energy can rate can be accessible with pythonic module. 
            Region being calculated with spherical harmonic matrix. 
        
            Can also lead to detection of future electric discontinuity during M and X Class Solar flare. 
        
        Installing
        =====================================
          It is using distutils(setup.py), so you can easily install this on most system with no trouble.
          From the base dir:
          python setup.py install (you would need root access depending on the system being used('sudo'))
          
          You can download the latest versions released from <<No pypi for the moment, crude develpt and 
          in correct stuff will cause problem and rejection, but maxistedeams will release it >>
          or download the development version straight from the mercurial repository hosted by me at:
          git://github.com/priendeau/PyNOAAGeoMagIndiceHandler.git.
        
        Documentation
        ========================================
          Is currently lacking, about every method is documented in the source. But future prototype will
          become move and more verbosis and Final realse will include test-case and a lot of documentation.

         Ugly Ascii art because you fall on something unattended...
