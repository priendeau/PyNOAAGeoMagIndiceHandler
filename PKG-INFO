Description: A python interface to Space NOAA
        =========
        A python interface to Space NOAA Magnetometer, Solar Wind Electron Proton, Differential Flux and
        Anisotropy Index from ACE and Stereo A, B satellite.
        
        In this package, I inclued pyaeso and bctc and  Lomnick\xc3 \xc5t\xc3t Neutron detector as well
        Space NOAA Magnetometer, Solar Wind Electron Proton, Differential Flux and Anisotropy Index,
        to cross data.
        
        This Module is a project aim to get folding indice of magnetic permeability while solar
        flare higher than Class M. This Solara flare are mitigating the electricity current
        flow during solar flare event and magnetic storm, and can be predicted by corrected
        humain normal energy consumption prediction and the normal proton pression existing
        around many region where energy can rate can be accessible with pythonic module.
        Region being calculated with spherical harmonic matrix.
        
        Can also lead to detection of future electric discontinuity during M and X Class Solar flare.
        
        Installing
        ==========
        It is using distutils(setup.py), so you can easily install this on most system with no trouble.
        From the base dir:
        python setup.py install (you would need root access depending on the system being used(`sudo'))
        
        You can download the latest versions released from <<No pypi for the moment, crude develpt and
        in correct stuff will cause problem and rejection, but maxistedeams will release it >>
        or download the development version straight from the mercurial repository hosted by me at:
        git://github.com/priendeau/PyNOAAGeoMagIndiceHandler.git.
        
        Documentation
        =============
        Is currently lacking, about every method is documented in the source. But future prototype will
        become move and more verbosis and Final realse will include test-case and a lot of documentation.

        Ugly Ascii art because you fall on something unattended...
